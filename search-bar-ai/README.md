## Steps to run the searchbar flask

1. Use pip install the relevant libraries into your python (working for v3.10)

    Navigate to search-bar-ai directory and run this in terminal

        py -m pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    OR 

        py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        
    If it fails, then install manually with reference to requirements.txt

        py -m pip install [insert module to install here]

2. Run the flask locally using your terminal in the search-bar-ai directory.

        flask run
