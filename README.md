README for SDS Team 12 HEX-EYE Project

# Service Design Studio 2022

## DBS x SUTD in collaboration with Google.

Having over 100+ Digital banking services on mutliple platforms, DBS has embraced the digital transformation. However, customers may not be **aware** of such changes and continue to make their journey to the Branch to have their needs met. This results in longer waiting times and an unpleasant customer experience. How can we help to boost the awareness of digital services to reduce the branch visit numbers?
